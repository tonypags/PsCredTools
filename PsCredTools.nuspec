    <summary>Tools for automating credentials safely in PowerShell.
    </summary>
    <description>This PowerShell Module will allow a user to work with (test, store, and retreive, etc.) windows credentials in an XML file. By Default the file will be located under the user's profile. The credential XML file exports will only work for the user who created the file, and only on the computer where the file was created. </description>
